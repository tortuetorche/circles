**Bring cloud-users closer together.**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/circles/master/screenshots/0.12.0.png)

Circles allows your users to create their own groups of users/colleagues/friends. 
Those groups of users (or circles) can then be used by any other app for sharing purpose 
(files, social feed, status update, messaging, â€¦) through the Circles API

Different types of circles can be created:


- A **Personal Circle** is a list of users known only to the owner.  
This is the right option if you want to do recurrent sharing with the same list of local users.

- A **Public Circle** is an open group visible to anyone willing to join.  
Anyone can see the circle, can join the circle and access the items shared to the circle.
 
- Joining a **Closed Circle** requires an invitation or a confirmation by a moderator.  
Anyone can find the circle and request an invitation; but only members will see who's in it and get access to shared items.

- A **Secret Circle** is an hidden group that can only be seen by its members or by people knowing the exact name of the circle.  
Non-members won't be able to find your secret circle using the search bar.

# Configuration

## Allow usage of Circles in non-SSL environments

In non-SSL environments (like on development setups) it is necessary to set two config flags for Circles:

`./occ config:app:set circles --value 1 allow_non_ssl_links` 

`./occ config:app:set circles --value 1 local_is_non_ssl`

## Allow mirroring circles as groups

```bash
./occ maintenance:mode --on

./occ config:app:set circles --value 1 group_backend # Mirroring circles as groups
./occ config:app:set circles --value 0 allow_listed_circles # Hide circles in shared list, useful with the 'group_backend' option

# ./occ config:app:set circles --value "ðŸŒ€ " group_backend_name_prefix # You can customize group name prefix
# ./occ config:app:set circles --value " " group_backend_name_suffix # Remove default group name suffix with a `space` character

./occ config:app:set circles --value 12 allow_circles # Only show 'public' and 'closed' circles
./occ config:app:set circles --value 1 skip_invitation_to_closed_circles

./occ config:app:set circles --value 0 allow_files_filtered_by_circles # Disable files list filtering by circles in the 'files' application
./occ config:app:set circles --value 0 allow_adding_any_group_members # Adding group members only for groups where the current user is a member or global administrators

./occ maintenance:mode --off
```
